# Development override for docker-compose
# Usage: docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up
#
# This configuration:
# - Runs the app in watch mode (auto-reloads on file changes)
# - Mounts source code so changes are picked up without rebuild

services:
  automod:
    command: ["bun", "run", "dev"]
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
